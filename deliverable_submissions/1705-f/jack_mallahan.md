# Strengths & Storytelling Reflection Guidelines

Build on your professional story by thinking about how you're progressing at Turing. Answer the questions below in your own gist to use your StrengthsFinder themes to add to your story:

* Look at your initial StrengthsFinder reflection that you completed in week 1 -- how have your perceptions of the top 5 themes stayed the same? How have they changed?

I think my perceptions of my top 5 themes have stayed pretty much the same. I feel like a huge part of my success so far at Turing has come from my strengths of Adaptability, Ideation, WOO, Developer, and Positivity. The one thing that has changed a little bit is that in my current paired project, ideabox, I have not been as focused on being a developer as I usually am. My partner is great, but sometimes he isn't understanding what logic we are using and I haven't been as good at helping catch him up to speed as I usually am. I think that the stress of the upcoming deadline has been a huge hinderence to my developer nature.


* How are you different today than when you first started at Turing? How are you stronger now than on day 1? How have you struggled? 

I definitely have way more of a growth mindset now than when I started at Turing. In the past, school has always come pretty easy to me so when I hit obstacles, I would give up. But at Turing I hit obstacles every hour, if not more often. The work and the shaping of the mindset that Turing provides has really helped me overcome my fixed mindset and get gritty! I have definitely struggled with this project and have felt like giving up many times. I finally just had a breakthrough right before this gear up and the functionality that has eluded me is working!

* Considering how you describe these themes, how do you want others to see you as you continue to progress through Turing?

I think that it is extremely important for me to exude my strengths, especially WOO, Developer, and Positivity. 

* Even though your Turing story isn't finished yet, what do you envision for your development in future mods? How will this story end?

* Finally, write a draft of your story here. This is a short paragraph, 4-6 sentences, describing who you are, why you came to Turing, and what you hope to accomplish while you're here:
