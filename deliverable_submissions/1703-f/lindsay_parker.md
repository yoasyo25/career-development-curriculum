## Mod 2 Deliverables:

* Documentation of mentor outreach conducted using these [guidelines](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_two/cold_outreach_i_guidelines.md)

   * Name of contact:
      * David Whitaker 3/19
      * Emily Freeman 5/14

   * Outcome (i.e., did you get a response? If not, what is your follow-up plan? Did you meet? When? What was the result?)

      * Received responses (after one follow-up note) in both cases
         * Lunch with David Whitaker, great conversation around jobs & careers but unlikely we'll get together regularly
         * Lunch with Emily Freeman scheduled for 6/6 to discuss industry, etc.

   * How do you feel like this relationship will benefit you in your longterm professional development?
      * If Emily has time, a longer-term mentoring relationship could be valuable to both of us to better understand the industry and mostly to have someone to bounce ideas off of and to keep each other honest to our personal expectations, as I've found valuable in my strongest mentorship relationships to date.

* Reflection on agile practices/project management used in projects
   * I thought this was a great session!  I've done some reading on Agile and my previous job took some of the key components of the practice, so I thought the overview was valuable as well as the discussion of how the industry has arrived at this practice.
   
   
* Feedback II reflection: In-person feedback conversation
   * Ouch.  I very much appreciated the value of this lesson, but the forced, right now, in-person feedback was unexpected and I definitely wasn't prepared to vocalize the feedback I'd wanted to provide to my partner.  I'm grateful to have had a level of relationship with my partner though where my stumbling through the feedback wasn't too detrimental and fortunately proved helpful.
   
* Feedback III reflection: Feedback implementation reflection & application of strengths to teams

   * *How have you changed since starting at Turing?  How have your strengths helped you in that progress?*
I'm not sure, to be honest.  I've absolutely built and strengthened relationships, as would be expected given my results from StrengthFinder.

   * *How do you feel like you have used your strengths when you've paired with others?*
Both CONNECTEDNESS and RELATOR are major strengths when it comes to pairing.  It's establishing relationships and encouraging the best from people.

   * *How could you utilize these strengths more?*
More relationships!  My strengths of DISCIPLINE and RESPONSIBILITY are already in high gear as deadlines and project requirements are received, so it's the relationships that could be further improved.

   * *What gets in your way or keeps you from fully using your strengths?*
I don't believe that anything does.
