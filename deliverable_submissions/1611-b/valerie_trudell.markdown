Goal: have 3 job offers by the end of the mod. 

Strategy To Achieve Goals:


Coding:
------------
- Attend class and complete all work 
- 1 ruby/ 1 javascript code challenge a week 
- spend 1 hour learning about security analysis 


How will you focus your learning to accomplish your longterm goal?

- Focus on ways to make applications the most secure while writing them. 


Opportunities Research:

How will you continue researching companies and contacts? How will you utilize your Trello Board?
- Find 30 companies I'd like to work: use buildincolorado / clutch / hired / website that gives you code challenges
- email each about learning more about the company 
- if they reply ask for an informal interview/ job shadow  
- afterward apply for a position if they are still a company I like 

Trello: update daily - companies I like / companies I've talked to / companies I've done an informal interview with

Cold Outreach/Network:

any Turing network that is in security 

Personal Branding (A personal branding section is optional):

Timeline:
----------------

What will you do when?
Module Tasks: 
- find companies
- establish contact 
- go to any meetups
- learn as much as possible about security

What will you do throughout the module?
Weekly Tasks:

- find 10 companies 
- establish contact 
- go to any meetups possible that have to do with security/backend development 
- learn anything about security 
- weeks 2-6 study for certification
- after graduation take certification

What I Will Work on with Meg

- anybody in security? 
- work on story? 
- finding companies? 

What advice do you need? What would be helpful to talk through? Let Meg know here! 

I need a process to get from knowing of a company that I'd like to work for to getting an informal interview. I don't really know how to do that. I'd like to talk more about it and work out some kinks.
