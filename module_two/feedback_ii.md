[Slides for this session](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1iLKN-7mCeQCaYulVT_LOsC4ctKjVgG63fNBRijtf33E/edit?usp=sharing)

### Session Structure

* Opening
* 

### Objectives
* Understand how intent and impact affect dialogue
* Understand the different stages of a feedback conversations
* Discover how to set boundaries and stay on track in these conversations
* Practice active listening and reframing feedback
* Deliver feedback in a constructive conversation

### Deliverable

Have a feedback conversation and document it using these [guidelines](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_two/feedback_conversation_reflection_guidelines.md)

### Opening
Why is working on our skills for giving and receiving feedback so important? Why have we chosen this as a skill for you to work on in your career development at Turing?

* Whole group discussion
* Discuss objectives and deliverable

Last module, we focused on giving written feedback. Today, we'll discuss techniques for providing feedback in a face-to-face conversation. 

### Review: Intent vs. Impact
Whole Group Review:

* What do we mean by *intent* and *impact*?
    The intent (the purpose behind the giver's message) may not always align with its impact (how the receiver is affected by the message) in conversation. 

Turn & Talk: 
* How might intent and impact function differently in a verbal conversation vs. written feedback? 
* What are some norms you might want to set when having an in-person feedback conversation in order to more fully align your intent with your impact?

2-3 groups share out. 

### Review: Blind Spots
Blind spots are always present as a gap between the self we think we present and the self that others see. Even with good intentions, your thoughts and feelings can affect the impact of your communication through behaviors that you don't always notice. These can include:

* Your facial expressions
* Your tone of voice
* Your behavior patterns

#### Whole Group Discussion:

* What might blind spots look like in conversation? Looking for examples.
* How does a certain blind spot affect the impact of the message?
* How can you be more aware of your blind spots?

### Communicating Feedback 
Ask for the type of feedback you want - and prime yourself for triggers that could arise in response to it. Reminder - the 3 types of feedback are:

* Appreciation
* Coaching
* Evaluation

How to conduct a feedback conversation:
* **Open** the conversation by getting aligned
   * Define the purpose of the conversation
   * What kind of feedback are we discussing?
   * What does the giver want to give me?
   * Is the feedback negotiable or final? A suggestion or a command?
* **Body:** Two-way exchange of information
   * Listening
   * Asserting
   * Managing conversation process
   * Problem-solving
* **Close** by committing to action

What will make this conversation different with a project team vs. having this conversation with just one partner?

### Switchtracking
When you're receiving feedback in a conversation, it's easier to fall prey to our triggers because we're experiencing them right in the moment. We often experience relationship triggers during a feedback conversation because of the way the other person delivers the feedback. A common reaction to this trigger is Switchtracking. Switchtracking occurs when we stop listening to what the person is saying and instead focus on our issues with the person. Here's what it looks like:

| Step 1 | You get feedback | 
| Step 2 | You experience a relationship trigger and may question the person's skills/judgment, credibility, or intentions |
| Step 3 | You change the topic to how you feel |
| Step 4 | You talk past (or think past) the other person who continues to stay on the original topic. |

Suddenly, neither of you are on the same page, and the feedback isn't getting heard. 

#### Tips for Getting Back on Track
* Spot the two topics, the original one and the relationship one. You must increase your awareness of what's happening. 
* Separate the who from the what. Discuss each separately on its own track
* Help the feedback giver be clear about their meaning
* Explore the dynamic in the relationship and identify what each of you is doing that contributes to the problem
* When you get coaching feedback, watch for possible relationship issues that might lurk below the surface

Discuss example with whole group:

| Feedback Giver | Feedback Receiver |
| -------------- | ----------------- |
| I'd like to see you ask for my input more. | You don't trust me to complete this on my own? |

* What two topics are being discussed here?
* How could you address both of these topics on their own tracks?
* How could the feedback giver be more intentional with their feedback?

Relationship system: is there time?..........

### How to Mitigate Switchtracking: Set Boundaries for the Conversation



#### Small Group Discussions
In groups of 3-4, discuss how to address this switchtracking conversation. Start by ....



#### Read, Pair, Share
An important skill from the body stage is **listening.** What does it mean to actively listen? What can make it difficult to really listen to someone?

Read through these [5 steps for improving listening skills](https://www.fastcompany.com/3036026/5-ways-to-improve-your-listening-skills)

Then pair up with someone else to have a short conversation. Describe to your partner a recent concept that you've learned at Turing and what that experience was like for you. Your partner will practice active listening and repeat back what they've heard from you.

**Takeaways:** 
* What went well for you in this practice?
* What will you need to be aware of as you continue working on your listening skills?

### Putting it into Practice: Having the Conversations
Now is the time to prepare for giving feedback to your project partners in conversations:

* BE: Bike Share (multiple partners)
* FE: Game Time (1 partner)
* Write down any key points, think about how you can clearly explain your intent, and take into consideration what kind of feedback you need from the other 
* This is one conversation on how the project is going so far and how you want to finish it, but consider any feedback that will need to be discussed after the project is over

### Next steps
* As your project wraps, make sure to have any continued or follow-up conversations with your project partners, including a full retro. 

* Reflect in your deliverable using the [template](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_two/feedback_conversation_reflection_guidelines.md) on at least 1 feedback conversation *(but you should be having conversations each time you work with someone else)*

* Complete a personal reflection:
    * What is your biggest challenge when giving feedback to someone else? What will you need to be aware of to overcome that challenge? 
    * In a year from now, if you’re practicing these conversations regularly, how will your communication skills have changed?
