[Slides for this lesson](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1DNPivOJBUUnWlwD-n-2K9dysidWPyVFaqCvMmy87Irw/edit?usp=sharing)

### Session Structure:
* Opening: objectives, deliverables, recap on cold outreach/networking and the why (8 mins)
* Cold Outreach Overview (20 mins)
* Meetup Speaker Overview (10 mins)
* Technical Blog Post Overview (10 mins)
* Work time (10 mins)
* Closing (2 mins)

### Objectives
* Understand the purpose of cold outreach and networking in regards to your job search
* Discuss how to leverage the network you have to find new relationships
* Implement strategies to write effective outreach emails OR research Meetups to speak at OR brainstorm ideas for a technical blog post

### Deliverable
For this deliverable, you have 3 options to choose from. To fulfill the deliverable requirement, you only need to submit documentation of 1 option although you're absolutely encouraged to do more than one. Whichever option you choose, you'll need to submit your deliverable via the [PD submissions repo](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/tree/master/deliverable_submissions). All three of these options are meant to push you out of your comfort zone when it comes to the role of networking in your job search -- *blindly submitting resumes is not the way to go in the tech industry.* These options are meant to help you start forming meaningful connections that will lead to increased exposure in the industry and more job leads. Check each option for specific due dates:

#### Option 1: Cold Outreach
Start to meet others in the industry through informal research conversations. How do you meet them? Send them a cold outreach email and then set up a coffee meeting. To fulfill this deliverable, provide a synopsis of 6 cold outreach interactions following these [guidelines](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_four/cold_outreach_deliverable_guidelines.md) by **Monday of Week 5**

A suggested way to break down completing this deliverable:

* Week 1: Complete 1 email today! Conduct more research for who you will contact
* Week 2: Complete 1 email
* Week 3: Complete 2 emails 
* Week 4: Complete 2 emails
* Week 5: Submit your summary of interactions using the guidelines above to the submissions folder

#### Option 2: Speak at a Meetup
Many Meetups are interested in having new people come speak to their communities, and beginner's tracks are the norm at many major Meetups. Contact the Meetup organizers, propose a talk idea (this can be about anything!), and get on their list. If you start to make this habit, organizers will begin to contact *you* when they need someone to fill in. This is a great opportunity to meet people and help out local meetups. To complete this deliverable, submit a gist by **Monday of Week 5** listing:  

* Which Meetup you spoke at/will be speaking at and why you chose that Meetup
* Your talk outline (1-2 paragraphs)
* 3-4 sentences on how you hope to utilize this talk to help you in your job search
 
It's okay if the Meetup hasn't happened by the deliverable deadline, but we'd like to see documentation that you've prepared to give this talk. 

#### Option 3: Write a Technical Blog Post and Promote it Through Your Network
If writing is more your style, you can choose to write a blog post about something you've learned during your time at Turing. In the blog post, we'll be looking to see:

* How you communicate technical details
* How you break down complicated processes into simple steps
* A desire to give back to the tech community
* A passion for learning and exploring new things

(Potential employers will be looking for those things as well)

One of the best places to post a technical post is [Medium](https://medium.com/). The audience reach is built in, and you're able to post to social media sites with ease. To complete the deliverable, include a link to your blog post and 3-4 sentences on how you're using this blog post to connect with other people in your network (example: posting the blog post on Twitter and engaging in follow-up conversations there) in your PD submissions. Please submit a link to your blog post by **Monday of Week 5**

### Opening
In the last cold outreach session in Module Two, our focus was mostly on "warm outreach" as you used the mentorship network at Turing to start building relationships. But now we'll take the same principles from that session and apply them to creating relationships with people outside of the Turing community. 

**Whole Group Discussion:** What are the best practices? 

### Why Cold Outreach & Networking
When it comes to your job search, meeting people to have discussions about companies and experiences is much more effective than sending your resume out into the abyss. Creating opportunities to meet those people is where cold outreach and networking come in. The technology industry is a relatively small community, and networking is key to becoming a part of that community. 

### Cold Outreach
**Whole Group Discussion:** When you're reaching out to people, what is your purpose? Hint: it's not to ask for a job. 

Suggested purposes:

* Research conversations 
* Tour office
* Hiring junior developers

Most common purpose: Research Conversations -- what is the purpose of these conversations? How can you approach this? 

Here are some [possible questions to ask](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11pkBWm3ZlN7disCY9T0Rg61ElwBzXgUf3VPuTRT05Zg/edit?usp=sharing)

### How to Leverage Your Network
How can you leverage the network you already have? 

* Mentors: who does your mentor know who would be helpful to you? 
* Use your Trello Board: what companies are you researching? Who can you contact from those companies?
* LinkedIn: who works at companies that you're interested in?

### Put the COLD in Cold Outreach
When creating a completely new relationship, here are some tips:

* No Turing/gSchool/HA alumni
* Try to avoid companies where alums are working
* Someone you've met but not worked with is OK
* Where are alumni already working? Here is a quick list (but not exhaustive) of companies that you should skip:

8th Light, Active Network, AdHawk, Advantage Integrated, Agilion, Allstate, American Thrombosis and Hemotosis Network, Aurigae, Blue Apron, Bonobos, Brandfolder, CA Technologies, Captain U, CareZone, Cirro, Coders Workshop, Cognizant Quick Left, CustomInk, DHR.net, Democracy Works, Digital Ocean, DispatchHealth, Ello, Equal Opportunity Schools, FanDuel Inc, Gitlab, Glassbreakers, GoSpotCheck, Gramercy Tech, Granicus, Guild Education, Harry Fox Agency (aka SESAC/Rumblefish), Huron, Impekable, Influx Data, Inquicker, Inspirato, Instacart, Invoca, Kite, Muve Health, NextRequest, Optum, Oracle, Politech, Procore, Real Geeks, Rumblefish, Shopify, Splice, Stitch Fix, TEKSystems, Tack Mobile, Tendril, Trelora, United Health Group, Vermont Public Radio, Vulk Coop, Wazee Digital, WellMatch/Aetna, Welltok Inc, Western Union, Wombat Security, eGauge Systems, iCentris, iTrellis

If you'd like to check any other company, feel free to DM Meg.

### Do Some Research
What do you know about the person you're contacting? 

Find out where their interests lie. Read their Medium blog posts, sign up for their newsletters, and check out their websites. Some other resources:

* Research their projects on GitHub
* Find individuals on GitHub
* Look for community builders (events, sponsors, etc)
* Mine Meetup
* [Built in Colorado](http://www.builtincolorado.com/companies): find more companies
* [Slacklist](http://www.slacklist.info/) 
* [AngelList](https://angel.co/)
* [CrunchBase](https://www.crunchbase.com/#/home/index) 

You need to understand your contact's goals as much as you want them to know yours.

### Finding Contact Info
Tools:

* [Email Hunter](https://emailhunter.co/)
* [Find That Lead](https://findthatlead.com/)
* GitHub
* Personal website  

### Crafting your Email
Develop a template to use. This will help you stay on script and get to the point.

1. Use the subject line: 

    * Short and real - lose the sales pitch
    * Relevant and personal
    * Consider how the snippet extends the subject line
    
    "Life at [amazing company]" 
    OR
    "Would like to connect"
    OR
    "Quick Question"
    
2. Greeting (simple, not overly formal). Make sure to spell their name right: 
    
    Hello [Name],
    
3. Body: 

    *Who am I? How did I find you? What do I want?*
    
    I'm a software developer in Denver about to graduate from the [Name of program] at Turing School of Software & Design. I found your contact info after researching education-focused startups in Denver. I'm interested in learning more about the work going on at [Company Name] and the Colorado startup scene in general. 
    
    *What interesting experience do I have that might make me worth meeting?*
    
    Before Turing, I taught in Denver Public Schools as a third and fourth grade teacher. 
    
    *Call to action*
    
    Could we grab coffee or get on the phone this week? How does this Wednesday at 4pm sound?
    
4. Closing (keep it simple):

      Thanks,
      
      [Your Name & contact info. Include your personal site if applicable]

Because you've researched your contact, you'll know if there are certain things you may have in common, such as:

* Fellow Bootcamp grad -- mention that you'd like to learn more about their transition from bootcamp to the tech industry
* Consider timing based on your research -- have they recently launched a new product? You could tie your message to events or activities that are top of mind to the recipient
* Connections -- even if you don’t know someone in common you may have some other connection, like a school or other organization

### What NOT to do
* Use an overly formal tone
* Write a lengthy email (less is more, longer emails won't be read)
* Spell their name or company name wrong
* Writing a generic email (make sure to tailor it accordingly)

### Follow Up
**What if they don't respond?**
If you don't receive a response, don't assume that means the conversation is dead. During busy weeks, emails can get lost. Send a follow-up email to say that you're still interested in meeting and suggest a new date/time. If you don't receive a response after that, move on to another contact.

If you receive a response saying they're too busy to meet that week or something similar, ask for a better time, and set up a meeting accordingly. Persistence pays off, and you're making it clear that meeting them is important to you. 

**What if they do respond?**
Use the meeting to build a relationship. 

Do:

* Ask questions -- ask about experience, projects, where they’d work next, what they’d change about their current role/team, advice for getting started in the industry
* Make eye contact
* Have your story ready to share
* Bring pen + paper, leave computer closed

Don't:

* Ask for a job
* Talk about yourself too much

### Speaking at a Meetup

**Whole Group:** How have you learned from other developers thus far in your tech career?

Chances are, you've learned from other developers' talks and own discoveries in their learning. With this option, you can join the community through giving back. Speaking at a meetup is a very effective way to impart knowledge, gain experience speaking, and provide your career with some exposure. 

#### How to Approach This
Pick a Meetup that you like

OR 

Pick a Meetup that sounds interesting


OR 

Look for kinds of topics have been covered at this Meetup recently -- how could you contribute?

#### Utilize Your Network
* Denver.rb beginner's track is run by former Turing instructor, Andrew Carmer 
* Mentor Ian Douglas frequently includes Turing students and alumni as speakers at the Boulder Python meetup
* See what other meetups that Turing community members are involved in

#### Prepare Your Talk
A great way to approach your talk is to utilize the format of “here’s what I learned when I tried to _______." This is how you've learned from other developers and how they will learn from you. 

* Join #speakercorps on Slack to ask questions and get feedback from current students, alumni, and mentors on your talk

#### Contact the Organizers
Reach out to the organizers to find out their upcoming schedule and pitch your talk. Utilize the same cold outreach principles discussed above. 

#### Your Turn


### Writing a Technical Blog Post and Showing it Off

####

#### Utilize Personal Branding Tools
Medium is a very effective 



### Closing & Next Steps
Remember to document your cold outreach and networking opportunities in your Trello board -- this will also make it easier to fill out the deliverable guidelines when you've kept a record of what has happened. 



### Practice & Group Feedback
Spend ten minutes drafting an email to the person you've been researching. Be sure to include:

* Subject line
* Connection
* Call to action with a specific date and time

**Pair & Share:**
Form groups of 3-4 (4 max) and spend 15 minutes giving and receiving positive feedback and suggestions for improvement. Person A will read email and person B & C will both give:

* 1 specific piece of appreciative feedback
* 1 constructive recommendation for improvement

Reminder of guidelines for feedback conversations. Be specific, actionable, and kind! Here are examples:

* “I really like the way you circled back to the company mission!”
* “Your subject line does a great job of capturing the reader's attention!”
* “The personal connection about snowboarding was really clear!”
* "I wasn't quite sure what your connection was. Try out a few different phrases to get more specific."
* "I didn't hear a call to action. Provide a date and time to meet to make it easy for someone to respond."

“Good job buddy!” is *NOT* constructive feedback
